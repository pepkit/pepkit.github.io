`looper` is a command-line job submitting engine. It's the **glue that connects your PEP project to command-line pipelines**. It can work with any pipeline that takes command-line arguments.  It also provides a flexible template system so that it can work with either local compute power or a cluster (using any resource manager, *e.g.* SLURM, LFS, SGE, *etc.*). `looper` makes it easy to run any kind of command-line tool serially across all the samples in your project. `looper` is not a pipeline workflow engine, which is used to build pipelines; it assumes you already have pipelines built, and it helps you map samples to those pipelines.

We provide a suite of already-built pipelines for ease-of-use, but you can configure it to work with just about anything. You have complete control.


### Code and documentation

* [Hello looper example repository](https://github.com/pepkit/hello_looper) - A very simple PEP and looper pipeline with hands-on tutorial.
* [User documentation and vignettes](http://looper.readthedocs.io)
* [Source code at Github](https://github.com/pepkit/looper)

### Quick start

Install with

```
pip install https://github.com/pepkit/looper/zipball/master
```

Once your PEP project and your pipelines are configured, you run your samples through `looper`  with this command:

```
looper run project_config.yaml
```

That command will parse your PEP samples, and build jobs for each one. Itâ€™s scalable: by default, it runs your jobs sequentially on the local computer, but with a small configuration change, it will create and submit jobs to any cluster resource manager (like SLURM, SGE, or LFS).

To check on your running jobs, you run:

```
looper check project_config.yaml
```

To summarize the statistics of all the pipeline runs, you type:

```
looper summarize project_config.yaml
```
